Paper presented to the 2023 Canadian Political Science Association Conference at York University, Toronto.</em></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"align-left\">This article focuses on three right-wing political influencers, arguably the most popular in Canada: Jordan Peterson, Ben Shapiro and Andrew Tate. It will be argued that these three individuals, although very different from each other, are nonetheless jointly contributing in a major way to metapolitics...</p>\n<p class=\"align-left\">A follow-up and discussion of these three men’s activities online over recent time will be offered. A computer-based, qualitative and quantitative measure of their impact is the basis for the analysis; tracking the content of their messaging, their number of followers and readership of their posts, and the impact these posts have on the followers. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>As part of this article, I extracted the post and corresponding comments in X (Twitter), Instagram and YouTube to measure:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The type of \"sentiment\" by the influencers.</li>\n<li>The type of \"sentiment\" by users in social media.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The purpose was to understand further their approach to social media and how a user in these networks perceived their ideas.</p>\n<p>The data was obtained in JSON format. Using a Python script the comments/texts were extracted and transformed to CSV.</p>\n<p>For the sentiment analysis it was used is the Twitter-roBERTa-base which is based on around 124 million tweets in English from 2018 to 2021 as an input to train the algorithm (Python Script). This model is hosted and available in the Huggingface community and created by the Research Group in Natural Language Processing at Cardiff University (Huggingface 2023).</p>\n<p>After analyzing around 2000 comments the results were visualized in bar charts using ggplot2 library in R. These are some of the plots created.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/J.Peterson.png\" data-size=\"1500x1500\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/J.Peterson-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/Shapiro.png\" data-size=\"1500x1500\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/Shapiro-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/Tate.png\" data-size=\"1500x1500\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/Tate-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/Tweets-influencers.png\" data-size=\"2000x2000\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://jcmarti415.github.io/JmPortfolio/media/posts/4/gallery/Tweets-influencers-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"768\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Based on the analysis and visualizations created, we made the following findings:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span data-preserver-spaces=\"true\">Although Andrew Tate's polemic figure, his publications show a more balanced set of emotions in his publications.

The first step was to extract the text through OCR using gImageReader to clean and extract the text into text files. After that using a Python script location names were extracted and geolocated with latitude and longitude coordinates. This data was cleansed manually using a combination of QGIS, MS Excel and R. </p>\n<p>Additionally, the most frequent human rights violation terms were counted and grouped into four categories: those related to murder, drugs, kidnapping and others. Using Python these categories were related to each observation.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, the database created includes the name of the original file, location name, longitude, latitude, and the word categories including a count of each of them. </p>\n<p>Limitations and scope:</p>\n<ol>\n<li class=\"align-left\">Observations (rows) are based on a unique combination of \"name of file\" and \"location\". This means that even if a place is presented multiple times in a document, it will be counted as one.</li>\n<li class=\"align-left\">This data is obtained from U.S. documents, which means that every insight is from this country and the government's point of view.</li>\n<li class=\"align-left\">It is challenging to detect and clean locations on a global scale. There are multiple locations across the world with the same name, as there are people and families with such names. There was an extensive effort to clean errors and miss-placed locations.
